**Today’s Progress**: I just finished remaining chapters of codeacademy Python course. I applied the knowledge in solving of 3 simple string manipulation challenges.

**Thoughts:** I wanted to contribute in some real projects on github, but it looked too hard. I started with something more simple. For D3 I need to do some more complex project, this was too easy.

**Today’s Progress**: I just finished chapters 9, 10, 11 of codeacademy Python course.

**Thoughts:** I really liked "introduction to Bitwise operators" module and "Classes". I am still not sure whether I use github.com correctly. I will watch some videos tomorrow.
