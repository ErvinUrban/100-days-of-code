**Today’s Progress**: I created script to remove specific files from a folder. I wanted to remove 1000+ files, the script saved my some time. I also completed few exercises on exercism.io

**Thoughts:** I should learn regular expressions.

**Today’s Progress**: 99 bottles of beer... Project is finished.

**Thoughts:** It is becoming harder to keep coding every day. My trip will start tomorrow morning, but I will code. When I come back I will start with more complex topics (maybe some edX / Coursera course focusing on data science)

R1D3: December 27th, 2017
</h2>

**Today’s Progress**: Today I spend few hours of setting up my workplace environment, installing OS, IDE, ... Then I started with my first webscrapping project. No tutorials, just coding and reading official documentation.

**Thoughts:** I achieved only very little progress in the project. Hopefully I am able to finish it tomorrow.

R1D2: December 26th, 2017
</h2>

**Today’s Progress**: I just finished remaining chapters of codeacademy Python course. I applied the knowledge in solving of 3 simple string manipulation challenges.

**Thoughts:** I wanted to contribute in some real projects on github, but it looked too hard. I started with something more simple. For D3 I need to do some more complex project, this was too easy.

R1D1: December 25th, 2017
</h2>

**Today’s Progress**: I just finished chapters 9, 10, 11 of codeacademy Python course.

**Thoughts:** I really liked "introduction to Bitwise operators" module and "Classes". I am still not sure whether I use github.com correctly. I will watch some videos tomorrow.
